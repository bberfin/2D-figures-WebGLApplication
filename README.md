# 2D-figures-WebGLApplication
a WebGL application(HTML+Javascript) that displays letters using geometric primitives.By using GUI elements and through keyboard and mouse,  user can change the color for the leters and reposition(translate),rotate,scale the letters together or separately.

#

In this project , I wrote a WebGL application that displays the first letter of my 
first name ( B ) and the last letter of my last name ( Z ) . 

To do this , I drew 2D figures using 
geometric primitive that is triangle
